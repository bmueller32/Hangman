# Hangman
Hangman Countries is a digital version of a classic game usually drawn on a whiteboard or piece of paper. It is a word game in which one player has to guess a word that the other player (in this case the computer) has thought of by guessing the letters in it. Every time they guess a wrong letter, part of a picture of a person being hanged is drawn, and if the picture is completed the person guessing has lost.
